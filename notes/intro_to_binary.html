  <h3>What is a Computer?</h3>

  <p>Let's take a second to think. You might be wondering, "...why is he asking us this? We know what a computer is, after all, we couldn't be in class together without one!" That's completely fair. Our generation has had more exposure to this tech than any other.</p>

  <p>I'm asking this for <strong>a very good reason</strong>, though. You'll understand why in just a moment. In order for us to learn how to code, we need to have a strong foundation to build upon. <em>So, what do you think? When you think about a computer, what comes to mind?</em></p>

  <p>I appreciate your participation! We're going to work together to refine our understanding of what computers are, so that by the end, you might even be able to teach your friends something new! If I were asked this question when I was your age, I'd probably say something below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"...it has a keyboard and a screen, and people can do work with it", or </li>
    <li>"...something I can play Minecraft on", or</li>
    <li>"...a device that connects to the internet, and lets me watch YouTube channels or Twitch streams."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All of these quotes mainly describe what a computer <i>can do</i>, not necessarily what they ARE. At their core, computers themselves can actually be defined in a much simpler way. To truly understand something <strong>by its definition</strong>, it's important that we don't include any unnecessary details.</p>

  <p>Before I give you this definition, though, I'm going to make a claim. Then, I will let you all decide if that claim is true or false. <strong>The claim:</strong></p>

  <p><b>A microwave isn't a computer.</b> True or false?</p>

  <p>What do you think? Am I right or wrong? Let me know your honest opinion, and then we can discuss. Whatever answer you side with, I encourage you to defend your stance!</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Let's turn our focus to today's video. We'll investigate the <i>precise</i> definition of a computer now! Go ahead and watch <strong>0:24-2:31</strong> of today's video.</p>
  
  <p>If you initially said that <b>my claim was false, great job! That's correct.</b> If you initially said that <b>my claim was true, no worries!</b> Let me explain why a microwave actually IS a computer, using the definition we just saw from the video. Recall, a computer does four things:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Take Input</b></li>
  <li><b>Store Data</b></li>
  <li><b>Process Data</b></li>
  <li><b>Output Results</b></li>
</ol>

<p>A microwave actually does all four of these every time that you use it! When you place food into the microwave, it <b>takes the food as input (1)</b>. Then, it <b>stores that food (2)</b> inside the compartment. After this has happened, the microwave then begins to <b>process the food (3)</b> by rotating and heating it. After the food is cooked, it <b>outputs the food (4)</b>, so that you can eat it!</p> 

<p>In this example, can anyone tell me what our computer's data is? Click the tab below to see the answer.</p>

<details><strong>In this case, the data is the food we put inside!</strong></details>
