  <p>Hello students! This is your go-to page for all lecture notes and review material for the CoderOgres course, if you ever miss a day or need to do some studying, you can find detailed records of everything we've covered. It is my hope that you'll use this as a handy reference whenever you need a bit of guidance. If you can't find what you're looking for here, message me on Canvas and I'll do my best to help you.</p>

  <p>I will post new links below as we move through the curriculum, so check back here regularly for updates. I will have each of the lecture's notes up before we cover the material, so take advantage of that! If you read over the notes the day before, it'll make retaining what we discuss much easier. If there's anything that's missing here, please let me know. I will fix it within a day or so. Also, <strong>the videos used during each lecture can be found inside!</strong> Take care everyone!</p>
