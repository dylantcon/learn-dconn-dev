  <h2>What is Debugging?</h2>
  <p>Debugging is like being a detective for your code. When something goes wrong (and it will - even for experienced programmers!), debugging helps you find out why and fix it. The term comes from an old story about finding an actual bug (a moth) in a computer!</p>

  <p>In this guide, we'll learn how to use Thonny, a beginner-friendly Python editor that makes debugging much easier.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Getting Started with Thonny</h2>
  <p>If you haven't already, download and install Thonny from <a href="https://thonny.org/" target="_blank">thonny.org</a>. It's free and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>

  <h3>The Thonny Interface</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Editor area:</strong> Where you write your code</li>
    <li><strong>Shell area:</strong> Where you see output and can test code</li>
    <li><strong>Variables panel:</strong> Shows what's stored in your variables (View → Variables)</li>
    <li><strong>Assistant panel:</strong> Helps explain errors (View → Assistant)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Using Thonny's Debugger</h2>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Debugging</h3>
  <p>Thonny has a special feature that lets you run your code line by line:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Write your code in the editor</li>
    <li>Click the "Debug current script" button (it looks like a little bug)</li>
    <li>Use these buttons to control the debugger:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step over:</strong> Run the current line</li>
        <li><strong>Step into:</strong> Go inside a function</li>
        <li><strong>Step out:</strong> Finish the current function</li>
        <li><strong>Resume:</strong> Run until the next breakpoint</li>
        <li><strong>Stop:</strong> Stop debugging</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Watch the Variables panel to see how your data changes</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Example: Debugging a Simple Program</h3>
  <pre>
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
next_year = age + 1
print(f"Next year, {name} will be {next_year} years old!")
  </pre>

  <p>If you run this program, you'll get an error! Let's debug it:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Click the debug button</li>
    <li>Step through each line</li>
    <li>Watch the Variables panel - notice that 'age' is a string, not a number!</li>
    <li>The error happens because we can't add 1 to a string</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The fix: Convert the input to a number:</p>
  <pre>
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))  # Convert to integer
next_year = age + 1
print(f"Next year, {name} will be {next_year} years old!")
  </pre>

  <h2>Common Python Errors and How to Fix Them</h2>

  <h3>1. SyntaxError</h3>
  <p><strong>What it means:</strong> You've written something Python doesn't understand</p>
  <p><strong>Common causes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing colons after if/for/while/def</li>
    <li>Unclosed parentheses, brackets, or quotes</li>
    <li>Using = instead of == for comparison</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <pre>
# Wrong:
if x > 5
    print("Big number")

# Right:
if x > 5:
    print("Big number")
  </pre>

  <h3>2. IndentationError</h3>
  <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Your code isn't lined up properly</p>
  <p><strong>Common causes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mixing tabs and spaces</li>
    <li>Inconsistent indentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <pre>
# Wrong:
if x &gt; 5:
print("Big number")  # Not indented!

# Right:
if x &gt; 5:
    print("Big number")  # Properly indented
  </pre>

  <h3>3. NameError</h3>
  <p><strong>What it means:</strong> You're using a variable that doesn't exist</p>
  <p><strong>Common causes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Typos in variable names</li>
    <li>Using a variable before creating it</li>
    <li>Variable is in a different scope</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <pre>
# Wrong:
print(messge)  # Typo!

# Right:
message = "Hello"
print(message)
  </pre>

  <h3>4. TypeError</h3>
  <p><strong>What it means:</strong> You're using the wrong type of data</p>
  <p><strong>Common causes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trying to add strings and numbers</li>
    <li>Using the wrong operation for a data type</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <pre>
# Wrong:
age = "15"
next_age = age + 1  # Can't add number to string!

# Right:
age = "15"
next_age = int(age) + 1
  </pre>

  <h3>5. IndexError</h3>
  <p><strong>What it means:</strong> You're trying to access something that doesn't exist in a list</p>
  <p><strong>Common causes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Counting from 1 instead of 0</li>
    <li>Going past the end of a list</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <pre>
# Wrong:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits[3])  # There is no index 3!

# Right:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits[2])  # Remember: counting starts at 0
  </pre>

  <h2>Debugging Tips and Tricks</h2>

  <h3>1. Use Print Statements</h3>
  <p>Add print statements to see what's happening in your code:</p>
  <pre>
score = 0
print(f"Score is now: {score}")
score = score + 10
print(f"Score after adding 10: {score}")
  </pre>

  <h3>2. Read Error Messages Carefully</h3>
  <p>Python error messages tell you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What type of error occurred</li>
    <li>Which line caused the error</li>
    <li>Often, what went wrong</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Use Thonny's Assistant</h3>
  <p>Thonny's Assistant panel explains errors in simple language. If you get an error, check what the Assistant says!</p>

  <h3>4. Test Small Parts</h3>
  <p>If something isn't working, test small pieces of code in the Shell area to understand what each part does.</p>

  <h3>5. Take Breaks</h3>
  <p>Sometimes the best debugging tool is taking a short break. Come back with fresh eyes!</p>

  <h2>Practice: Debug This Code</h2>
  <p>Try to find and fix all the errors in this program:</p>
  <pre>
print("Welcome to the number game!)
player_name = input("What's your name? ")
secret_number = 7
guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")

if guess = secret_number:
    print("You got it, player_name!")
else:
print("Sorry, the number was secret_number")
  </pre>

  <details>
    <summary>Click to see the solution</summary>
    <pre>
print("Welcome to the number game!")  # Fixed: closed quote
player_name = input("What's your name? ")
secret_number = 7
guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))  # Fixed: convert to int

if guess == secret_number:  # Fixed: use == for comparison
    print(f"You got it, {player_name}!")  # Fixed: use f-string
else:
    print(f"Sorry, the number was {secret_number}")  # Fixed: indentation and f-string
    </pre>
  </details>

  <h2>Remember: Everyone Makes Mistakes!</h2>
  <p>Even professional programmers spend a lot of time debugging. Errors are a normal part of learning to code. Each error is a chance to learn something new!</p>
